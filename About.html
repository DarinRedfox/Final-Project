                <p> The reason I consider these things to be important is because
                    since the development of the smartphone and the widespread use 
                    of social media it has changed the way we interact together
                    (for better or worse). The first time I learned of LinkedIn was
                    sometime in high school and signed up for it but didn't know exactly
                    how to use it and some time later my speech teacher from middle school
                    wanted to add me on there but later I deleted the account. Now I'm 
                    trying to start building a career and I want to start being a young
                    professional and LinkedIn is a stepping stone to this. Part of me
                    wishes I started an account around the fall of 2016.

                    As for learning how to use a Macbook, when I first started at
                    CodeCooperative and when we were issued a macbook and took the 
                    survey to rate our technology skills I thought I knew how to 
                    use a macbook but it turned out I was wrong. I'm doing the macbook
                    page because if you transition from Windows to Mac OS you'd think
                    it would'nt be too different from Windows but thats obviously not
                    the case so I don't want people to end up in the same predicament
                    as me.
