            <p>Macintosh OS or Mac OS is an operating system devloped by Apple between 1997 and 2001 for its desktop and later on
                    laptop computers after the purchase of NeXT. Its the basis for its other operating systems like iOS, the apple
                    the apple watches software as well as appleTV. Its also unable to be runned conventionally on non apple 
                    computers though you are able to run Windows on Mac. When I first started using MacOS I thought it 
                    wouldn't be too different from Windows but that certain wasn't the case.

                        There's no start button like Windows but to get something close the the start menu go look for 
                        scroll your mouse along the app bar and click LaunchPad which shows you all your applications.
                        On the top left of the gray menu bar you should see a tab labelled Go that should give you a small
                        list of that includes your document and downloads folder.

                                Key Chain is an app in Mac that creates passwords for you and stores them. It's a fantastic
                                security feature since if you rely on a few different passwords and one of them gets compromised
                                you risk someone getting access to multiple serious accounts whether is social media or your financial
                                information. Where Key Chain comes in that makes things better is that it can randomly generate
                                passwords for you so if one of your passwords gets into the hands of someone it shouldn't them it
                                shouldn't really pose a threat to your other log ins to other websites on the net.
