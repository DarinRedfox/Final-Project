                LinkedIn is a social media site created in 2003 and has an active user base
                of over 106 million people and what makes it different from other social media
                platforms is that primarily used for professional networking. Since many people
                get jobs through people they know versus their skills LinkedIn can be a great
                platform to build connections annd find someone to help you find that job or
                career you're looking for.
